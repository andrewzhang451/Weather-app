1. I chose to use Vue.js because it is easy to learn and its use case is best for small to medium-sized projects. It also has a large community and a large number of plugins and libraries that can be used to add functionality to the app. Vue.js also supports two way binding, which is best for my use case since I am using the skeleton of a preexisting project. This way, implementing the framework won't be as much of an issue compared to react, and especially compared to Angular.
