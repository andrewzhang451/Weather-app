1. I chose to use Vue.js because it is easy to learn and its use case is best for small to medium-sized projects. It also has a large community and a large number of plugins and libraries that can be used to add functionality to the app. Vue.js also supports two way binding, which is best for my use case since I am using the skeleton of a preexisting project. This way, implementing the framework won't be as much of an issue compared to react, and especially compared to Angular. 

Project Documentation:
- Project Overview:
    I have essentially created an web application where it either allows you to select pre-existing locations to check for sunrise and sunset or you can input your own location to check the weather. There is also a filter option that allows uses to select what they want to be displayed. 

- Technologies used:
    I have used Vue.js for the backend framework and css for front-end design. Visual Studio Code is my IDE of choice.

- Lessons Learned:
    I have learned that using Vue.js is slightly easier to use compared to React, especially in my use case, because Vue uses HTML-based templates by default. This makes it easier for me who is familiar with traditional web development to get started. Vue also offers JSX, which is a JavaScript-like syntax that can be used to create components. Overall, Vue.js is a good choice for my use case. Vue offers two-way binding system, which automatically updates the UI when the data changes, and vice versa. Since my application is relatively small sized, I did not have the issue of having a hard time tracking data flow.

- Future Scope:
    I would like to add more features to the application, such as a search bar to find locations, a map to display the location, and a database to store user preferences and saved locations. I would also like to improve the UI/UX of the application by adding more visual elements and animations.
